# LinkedList CellPhone Manager

This project is a custom implementation of a singly linked list in Java. It manages a list of `CellPhone` objects, each with attributes for serial number, brand, year of manufacture, and price.

## Classes

The project consists of three main classes:

1. `CellPhone`: Represents a cellphone object with attributes for serial number, brand, year of manufacture, and price.

2. `CellList`: A custom implementation of a singly linked list. It contains `CellPhone` objects in its nodes, referred to as `CellNode` objects.

3. `CellListUtilization`: The driver class for the program. It tests the methods of the `CellList` class.

## Usage

The program reads from a file named "Cell_Info.txt", creates `CellPhone` objects from the data, and adds them to a `CellList`. It then performs various operations on the `CellList`, such as adding, inserting, deleting, replacing, finding, and checking for the existence of `CellPhone` objects. I added a bunch of test cases that are commented out for the goal of anyone accessing this code to learn from it and to hopefully have a better understanding on singly linked list.
